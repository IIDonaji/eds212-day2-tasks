## Derivatives in R

# Finding derivatives using R. 

# f.

```{r}
# Find the slope of f(x) = x^2 at x = 3
fx <- expression(x^2)

ddf_dx <- D(expr = fx, name = "x")
ddf_dx

x <- 3
eval(ddf_dx)
```

# g. 

```{r}
# Find the slope of P(a) = 2(3a + 2)^4 - 5 at a = 1.2
Pa <- expression(2 * (3 * a + 2)^4 - 5)
Slope_Pa <- D(expr = Pa, name = "a")
Slope_Pa
```
